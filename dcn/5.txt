AIM: Simulate an ethernet LAN using N nodes(6-10). Change the data rate and compare throughput and bit error rate.

Step 1: Create a New Project
        Start a new project in the network simulation software.
        Set Ethernet On 

Step 2: Create Network Topology
        Use Rapid Configuration → Choose Star topology.
        Set:        star box-> 6 nodes
                    central node model= ethernet16_hub
                    peripheral node model= ethernet_station
                    link model = 10baseT

Step 3: Configure Ethernet Stations
        Select All Ethernet Stations → Right-click → Edit Attributes.
              Traffic generation parameters: start time=constant(0)
                                             ON State time=constant(100)
                                             OFF State time=constant(0)

              Packet Generation Arguments: Interarrival Time: constant(1)
                                           Packet Size= uniform(46,1500)
                                           Segmentation size= no segmentation
    
          Apply changes → Click OK.

Step 4: Choose Statistics for Analysis
        Right-click in workspace → Choose Individual Statistics 
        -> Link Statistics -> Low level Point to Point -> bit error per packet
                           -> Point to Point -> Throughput in and out (packets/sec)

        Confirm selection.

Step 5: Run the Simulation
        Click Run → Set Duration: 70 seconds → Start simulation.

Step 6: Modify Data Rate and Compare Results
        Change the data rate by changing the inter arrival time

        Scenario 1: Inter-arrival time = ( 1 second ) → Run simulation → Note throughput.

        Scenario 2: Inter-arrival time = ( 0.1 seconds ) → Run again → Note throughput.

Result: The data rate is changed by changing the inter arrival rate
    
        Lower inter-arrival time = Higher data rate and throughput, up to the point where collisions or network congestion occur, no of bit errors are increased.

        Higher inter-arrival time = Lower data rate, hence lower throughput, less congestion and less no of errors.
