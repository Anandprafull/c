Step 1: Create a New Project
Start a new project in the network simulation software.

Step 2: Create Network Topology
Use Rapid Configuration → Choose Star topology.

Set:

Central node: ethernet16_hub

Peripheral nodes: Ethernet station

Links: 10baset

A visual star topology will be created.

Step 3: Configure Ethernet Stations
Select All Ethernet Stations → Right-click → Edit Attributes.

Set Traffic Parameters:

Packet size, generation rate (inter-arrival time), destination, etc.

Apply changes → Click OK.

Step 4: Choose Statistics for Analysis
Right-click in workspace → Choose Individual Statistics.

Select:

Bit Error Rate: bit error per packet

Throughput: throughput [packets/sec]

Confirm selection.

Step 5: Run the Simulation
Click Run → Set Duration: 70 seconds → Start simulation.

Step 6: Modify Data Rate and Compare Results
Scenario 1: Inter-arrival time = 1 second → Run simulation → Note throughput.

Scenario 2: Inter-arrival time = 0.1 seconds → Run again → Note throughput.

Result and Observation:
Lower inter-arrival time = Higher data rate and throughput, up to the point where collisions or network congestion occur.

Higher inter-arrival time = Lower data rate, hence lower throughput.
