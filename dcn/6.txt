Steps:
Step 1: Create New Project
Open the simulation tool → Select New Project.

Name the project and choose a save location.

Step 2: Build Network Topology
From the Object Palette, add:

Application Config

4 × Ethernet Workstations (ethernet_wkstn)

1 × Ethernet Server

1 × Ethernet16 Hub

Connect all devices using 10Base_T bidirectional links.

Step 3: Configure Applications
Right-click Application Config → Edit Attributes.

Define traffic types (e.g., FTP, voice), packet sizes, data rates, etc.

Step 4: Set Application Profiles
Right-click Profile Config → Edit Attributes.

Create profiles:

Assign FTP profile to workstations and server.

Assign Voice profile to Node 2.

Step 5: Configure Network Nodes
Right-click each Ethernet Workstation → Edit Attributes.

Assign appropriate application profiles.

For Node 2: enable voice settings.

For Server: enable FTP service.

Step 6: Select Collision Statistics
Right-click on empty workspace → Choose Individual Statistics.

Go to: Node Statistics → Ethernet → Select "Collision Count".

Click OK to confirm.

Step 7: Run Simulation
Click Run Simulation (play button).

Set duration to 20 seconds → Start the run.

Step 8: View Results
Right-click empty space → View Results.

Choose Overlaid Statistics to compare collision counts per node on a single graph.

Result Interpretation:
Collision Count indicates congestion or contention at nodes.

Higher traffic nodes (e.g., Node 2 with voice and FTP) are expected to show more collisions.

Use this data to assess traffic management and efficiency in shared Ethernet environments.
