AIM: Simulate an ethernet LAN using N nodes and set multiple traffic nodes and determine the collisions across different nodes.

Step 1: Create New Project
        Open the simulation tool → Select New Project.
        Name the project and choose a save location.

Step 2: Build Network Topology
        From the Object Palette, add:
        
        Application Config
        3 × Ethernet Workstations (ethernet_wkstn)
        1 × Ethernet Server
        1 × Ethernet16 Hub

        Connect all devices using 10Base_T bidirectional links.

Step 3: Configure Applications
        Right-click Application Config → Edit Attributes.
        Set rows=2
            row0-> name:ftp, high load
            row1-> name:voice, GSM Quality Speech

Step 4: Set Application Profiles
        Right-click Profile Config → Edit Attributes.
        Set rows=2
            row0: name= ftpp
                  Applications: rows=1
                                row0: name=ftp
                                      Start Time Offset = const(1)
                                      Repeatability : Inter repetition Time = exponential(1)
                                                      No of Repetitions = Unlimited
                                                      Repetition Pattern = Concurrent
                  Start Time : constant(1)
                  Repeatability : Inter repetition Time = constant(1)
                                  No of Repetitions = Unlimited
                                  Repetition Pattern = Concurrent
        row1: name= voicep
                  Applications: rows=1
                                row0: name=voice
                                      Start Time Offset = uniform(5,10)
                                      Repeatability : Inter repetition Time = exponential(1)
                                                      No of Repetitions = Unlimited
                                                      Repetition Pattern = Concurrent
                  Start Time : constant(1)
                  Repeatability : Inter repetition Time = constant(1)
                                  No of Repetitions = Unlimited
                                  Repetition Pattern = Concurrent


Step 5: Configure Network Nodes
        Right-click any Ethernet Workstation → Select Similar nodes -> Right Click -> Edit Attributes.

        Application Supported Profiles : rows=2
                                         row0 : name = ftpp
                                         row1 : name = voicep

        Application Supported Services : rows = 1
                                         row0 : name = voice

        For ethernet_Server: enable FTP service.
                             Application Supported Services : rows = 1
                                         row0 : name = ftp

Step 6: Select Collision Statistics
        Right-click on empty workspace → Choose Individual Statistics.

        Go to: Node Statistics → Ethernet → Select "Collision Count".

        Click OK to confirm.

Step 7: Run Simulation
        Click Run Simulation (play button).

        Set duration to 20 seconds → Start the run.

Step 8: View Results
        Right-click empty space → View Results.

        Choose Overlaid Statistics to compare collision counts per node on a single graph.

Result : Collision Count indicates congestion or contention at nodes.
         This shows that for all other nodes the collision count is less compared to the server. This is because the FTP application uses TCP and demands retransmission whereas the voice             application uses UDP and retransmission is not required.

        TCP traffic faces high collision per packet in a network compared to UDP per packet
