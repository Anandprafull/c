AIM : Simulate an ethernet LAN using n-nodes and set multiple traffic nodes and plot the congestion window for different source/destination.

1. Create New Project
  Create a new project .

2. Build Network Topology
    Add devices:

    3 × ethernet_wkstn
    1 × ethernet_server
    1 × ethernet16_hub
    Application Config
    Profile Config

    Connect all nodes to the hub using 10Base_T links.

3. Define Applications
   Edit Application Config:

    Row 0: ftp, description: High Load

    Row 1: voice, description: GSM Quality Speech

4. Create Traffic Profiles
    Edit Profile Config:

    Row 0 (ftp profile):
                      Application: rows = 1
                                  row0: name=ftp
                                        Start: constant(1), 
                                        Repetition: exponential(0.1)
                                  Start: constant(1), 

    Row 1 (voiceprofile):

                      Application: rows = 1
                                  row0: name=voice                              
                                        Start: constant(1), 
                                        Repetition: exponential(0.1)
                                  Start: uniform(100,110), 

5. Assign Profiles to Workstations
    Select all 3 workstations > Edit Attributes:

    Application Supported Profiles: rows=2
                                    Row 0: ftp profile
                                    Row 1: voiceprofile

    Application Supported Services: rows=1
                                    Row 0: voice

  Select ethernet_server: 
                          Application Supported Services: rows=1
                                                          Row 0: ftp

6. Node Statistics : TCP Connection -> Congestion Window Size (bytes)

7. Run Simulation for 20s

8. Result: The TCP Congestion Window (cwnd) controls how much data the sender can send before waiting for an acknowledgment. 
           It reflects the sender’s perception of the network capacity and congestion. 
           A larger window means more packets in flight; a smaller window suggests congestion or network limitations.

          The congestion window increases at the start and then fluctuates as congestion occurs due to multiple TCP streams sharing a limited-bandwidth hub.
          The presence of voice traffic might reduce the available bandwidth for FTP, causing more frequent congestion signals and smaller average cwnd sizes.
