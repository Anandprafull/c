1. Create Project
Start a new project in the simulator (e.g., OPNET/NS2/NS3).

Set unit to meters for correct wireless range.

2. Add Wireless Nodes
Open Object Palette â†’ Select wireless_lan_adv.

Add 4 Ã— wlan_station_adv (fix) nodes to the workspace.

3. Configure Application Traffic
Draw a circle annotation around all 4 nodes to mark the network region.

Select one node â†’ Right-click â†’ Select Similar Nodes â†’ Edit Attributes:

Start Time: constant(0)

ON State: constant(100)

OFF State: constant(0)

Under Packet Generation Arguments:

Interarrival Time: exponential(1)

Click Apply Changes â†’ OK.

4. Enable Statistics
Right-click on workspace â†’ Choose Individual Statistics:

Under Wireless LAN â†’ Node Statistics:

âœ… Data Traffic Sent (packets/sec)

âœ… Data Traffic Received (packets/sec)

5. Run Simulation
Click Run Simulation icon.

Set Simulation Duration: 100 seconds

Click Run

6. View Results
Right-click â†’ View Results

Change view to:

From: As Is

To: Sample_Sum or Average

ðŸ“Š Result Interpretation:
Each node sends ~1 packet/sec

Each node receives ~2.5 packets/sec

Because it gets packets from 3 other nodes.

Some packet loss may be seen (can be analyzed further using bit/sec stats
