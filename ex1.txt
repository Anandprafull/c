Experiment 1: Point-to-Point Network with Duplex Links
This experiment simulates a ring topology using point-to-point duplex links. The goal is to analyze how bandwidth and queue size affect packet drops and throughput. Larger queue sizes can reduce packet drops, and increasing bandwidth improves transfer rate, though physical limitations of nodes might cap actual performance.
AIM: Simulate a three nodes point to point network with duplex links between them. Set the queue size and vary the bandwidth and find the number of packets dropped.

Queue Size: 8MB
Time: 10s
Throughput rate: 50000                                                                
Queue Size: 16MB
Time: 15s
INTERPRETATION:
From the above two graphs we can say that on increasing the throughput and queue size the number of packets transferred in the same amount of time, the number of packets transferred is increased in a node.(From last graph)
But the number of packets received remains constant , this might be due to the physical limitation of the nodes.(From 3rd graph)
The packets dropped per second decreases dramatically and becomes constant after some time (graphs 1 and 2) , This may be attributed to the larger queue size. Nodes may hold more packets and may drop fewer.

1. Queue Size Increased → More Buffering Capacity
2. Higher Bandwidth → Faster Transmission 
 3. Traffic Smoothing Over Time
