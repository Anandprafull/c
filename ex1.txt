Experiment 1: Point-to-Point Network with Duplex Links
The goal is to analyze how bandwidth and queue size affect packet drops and throughput. Larger queue sizes can reduce packet drops, and increasing bandwidth improves transfer rate, though physical limitations of nodes might cap actual performance.
AIM: Simulate a three nodes point to point network with duplex links between them. Set the queue size and vary the bandwidth and find the number of packets dropped.

6. Crete 2 more duplicate scenarios:
	8mb, 10000
	16mb, 5000


OUPTUT:
Throughput rate: 5000                                                                  
Queue Size: 8MB
Time: 10s
Throughput rate: 50000                                                                
Queue Size: 16MB
Time: 15s

INTERPRETATION:
From the above two graphs we can say that on increasing the throughput and queue size the number of packets transferred in the same amount of time, the number of packets transferred is increased in a node.(From last graph)
But the number of packets received remains constant , this might be due to the physical limitation of the nodes.(From 3rd graph)
The packets dropped per second decreases dramatically and becomes constant after some time (graphs 1 and 2) , This may be attributed to the larger queue size. Nodes may hold more packets and may drop fewer.

1. Queue Size Increased ‚Üí More Buffering Capacity
2. Higher Bandwidth ‚Üí Faster Transmission 
 3. Traffic Smoothing Over Time

Key Observations from the Simulation:
Queue Size vs. Packet Drops:

A larger queue size helps buffer more packets during traffic congestion, reducing packet drops.
As queue size increased from 8MB to 16MB, the number of dropped packets significantly decreased, confirming that buffer capacity plays a crucial role in loss mitigation.

Bandwidth vs. Throughput:

Increasing the bandwidth (e.g., from 5000 to 10000 datagram forwarding rate) allowed more data to be transmitted per unit time, thereby improving throughput.
However, performance improvements are subject to diminishing returns, as the processing limits of nodes can bottleneck gains despite higher bandwidth.

Traffic Statistics:

Nodes with higher memory and bandwidth consistently showed better metrics: higher traffic sent and received, and lower traffic dropped.
Global statistics mirrored node-level results, validating that the entire network benefits from optimized parameters.

üìà Final Interpretation:
Larger queue sizes and higher bandwidth collectively enhance network performance by minimizing packet loss and increasing data throughput.
However, node processing capacity (like datagram forwarding rate) imposes a physical ceiling on performance gains. Beyond a point, just increasing bandwidth or memory will not lead to proportional improvements.
Thus, for high-resolution video conferencing or similar bandwidth-intensive applications, balanced optimization of all three ‚Äî queue size, bandwidth, and node capabilities ‚Äî is essential for achieving efficient and lossless communication in point-to-point duplex networks.
