Experiment 2: TCP vs UDP Traffic Over Star Topology
Simulates a TCP and UDP communication network over a star topology. It contrasts reliable transmission (TCP) with fast but lossy transmission (UDP), ideal for understanding when each protocol should be used.
Experiment:2
Aim: Simulate a 4 node point to point network and connect the links as follows: n0-n2, n1-n2 and n1-n3. Apply TCP agent between n0-n3 and UDP n1-n3. Apply relevant applications over TCP and UDP agents changing the parameters and determine the no. of packets sent by TCP/UDP.

INTERPRETATION:
We can observe the difference in the Y axis in both the output graphs that is it is in the range of 100s for TCP and it is in the range of 10000s for UDP.
This implies or indicates that there is higher data rate in UDP. And therefore a higher data loss.
The loss rate is high in UDP especially since it is a video conferencing application with high data rate.
Whereas in TCP since congestion control is applied the loss rate is less and the graph is more even.
TCP is more reliable but has higher overhead. And UDP is faster but there is loss of packets.
