Experiment 4: Internet Traffic Simulation (FTP & Telnet)
Focuses on simulating and analyzing application-level traffic like FTP and TELNET. By adjusting load parameters, the experiment evaluates how increased network demand impacts throughput and performance.
Aim: Simulate the different types if internet traffic such as FTP, TELNET over a network and analyze the throughput.

NETWORK DESIGN:  STAR topology.

	•	4 ethernet_wkstn
	•	1 ethernet server
	•	2 ethernet4_slip8_gtwy routers (PPP_DS1 link)
	•	Application and profile config
	•	Connect both routers with bidirectional PPP_DS1 link
	•	Connect wkstns and server to the outers using 10base_T
	 

Parameters:
1.      Configure the Network Application: 
		Row0:
			Name: telnet

Interpretation:

Graph 1: Traffic Sent
	FTP:
		Shows a steady and consistent rise in the transmission rate.
		Indicates multiple concurrent file transfer sessions starting over time.
		Reflects increasing network usage for data-heavy operations.
	Telnet:
		Exhibits a sharper and more variable rise, highlighting active remote login sessions.
		Suggests that telnet traffic grows faster due to continuous keyboard-based interactions.

Graph 2: Load
	FTP:
		Load increases linearly and steadily, indicating sustained file transfer operations over time.
		Represents continuous bandwidth demand from multiple users.
	Telnet:
	Starts with a steep rise, followed by a linear increase, indicating quick user login followed by continuous session activity.

Conclusion : Increased Load → Higher Data Rate → More Collisions → Lower Throughput
	
When network load increases (e.g., due to FTP high load), throughput initially rises but may degrade due to packet collisions and retransmissions, especially in shared medium topologies.

FTP vs TELNET Behavior:

	FTP is bandwidth-intensive and leads to sustained load.

	Telnet generates interactive, bursty traffic, which is more sensitive to delay but consumes less bandwidth.

Graph1: Traffic Sent In FTP server we can see consistent increase over time that suggest that the number of FTP sessions increases corresponding to the transmission rate of the packets In Telnet the significantly increasing graph suggests that there’s heavy usage of the remote login and active transmission of data.
Graph2: Load In FTP server we can see a steady increase that suggest that file transfer is held concurrently over time suggesting a growing demand for file transfers in the network. In Telnet first we observe a sharp increase and then a linear growth.
Conclusion
Throughput: The actual rate at which information is sent over a channel. It is measured in bits/second or frames/second. When the load is increased, the data rate is increased, causing more collisions, therefore data loss, which in turn causes retransmissions. So we see due to high traffic throughput is reduced due to collision.
